    <h2 id="title1">The Lore of Kirby (As of Now): The Ancients</h2>
    <h6 class="name">By: Cuckoo Kirby fan - 28/7/2019</h6>
    <p>As we all know, Kirby is one of Nintendo’s mascot franchises. Even though it may not sell as well as the others, it is still beloved by many (and the sales still give enough support for HAL to continue making games). When Masahiro Sakurai left HAL,
        the Kirby series was in a slightly dark area of sorts (depending on your view of the games at the time). However, the Kirby series then received a new director: Shinya Kumazaki. With a new director came along a new twist... lore. Really, really
        deep and well-written lore. The new lore connected nearly everything in the series. Us Kirby fans LOVED the lore, and craved for more of it. With Star Allies being the most lore-heavy game to date, I decided to talk about all of Kirby lore as
        we know it. At least, all as of now. Lord help us when the next game releases.
    </p>
    <p>First off, let’s start with the most iconic lore characters: the ancients.
    </p>
    <p>The ancients, as their name implies, are people from long, long ago that are no longer around (or so we think). The ancients are iconic in the lore for being affiliated with almost everything. Let’s take a look at their history, shall we? The only
        planet confirmed to have been inhabited by the ancients is Halcandra, which is located in another dimension. Now, that’s not to say they didn’t inhabit Kirby’s dimension, as several of the ancients’ creations can be found there. Regardless, the
        ancients were highly advanced in science, as they created many legendary pieces of technology. According to Magolor, the Lor Starcutter, a ship that can traverse through space and time, was crafted by the ancients using an incredible power. He
        also states that they created “clockwork stars that soar the cosmos” using the same power. Many have presumed these stars to be Novas, clockwork cat faces that can grant wishes. This was seemingly proven in Kirby: Planet Robobot, where the final
        boss of the game, Star Dream, fused with the Access Ark, revealing it to actually be a Nova. According to Haltmann, his company analyzed the most advanced civilizations in the known universe and used blueprints they found in order to reactivate
        Star Dream. The Lor and the Novas were two examples of their skill in science, but they were also skilled in magic as well. Also according to Magolor, the ancients crafted “mysterious items that can bring dreams to life.” These are presumed to
        be the Star Rods, which power the Fountains of Dreams. Each fountain is responsible for giving every inhabitant in their respective planet good dreams. They also created the Master Crown, a crown that grants its wearer limitless power. However,
        the crown itself appears to be sentient, as it takes control of Magolor’s body and transforms him into a manifestation of itself. In this form, Magolor notably has an eye in his mouth. Many have thought the crown was Dark Matter because of this.
        While almost everyone else thought that wasn’t the case, those who said it was just might have been correct. We’ll get to that later. Anyway, those two are examples of the ancients’ skill in magic. Slightly off-topic, but since the ancients lived
        on Halcandra, it is likely that they made Egg Engines, and in turn, Metal General, which the Haltmann Works Company probably used the blueprints of in order to make the Security Force. The ancients also entrusted Landia, a four-headed dragon,
        in guarding the legendary treasures they made on that planet.
    </p>
    <p>However, that’s not even close to all the information about them...
    </p>
    <p>As Kirby Star Allies is the most lore-heavy game as of now, they wouldn’t dare to not include the ancients. As we all know, Hyness, the main antagonist of the game, dropped a lore bomb in the form of having a stroke and spouting it out at light speed.
        Given that the English localization butchered this lore bomb, we’ll take a look at the original Japanese version. According to Hyness, the people of his clan were powerful wielders of magic, and were friends with people who used the power of science.
        Hmm, sounds familiar. The people of his clan were also worshippers of a matter most dark. Anyway, one day, their science-using friends turned on them in fear of their power and banished them to the edge of the galaxy. As if that wasn’t enough,
        they then subsequently erased all but a sliver of their very existence from history itself. So yeah, most of them are dead. I think Hyness is like, a descendant from this sliver, but I have no idea since it’s totally unclear whether he’s the last
        survivor or a descendant. Anyway, he also states that his clan was responsible for stopping a galactic crisis of sorts. Why am I telling you about Hyness’s clan? Well, it’s been theorized that Hyness’s clan and these science-users WERE the ancients,
        and it kind of makes sense. Think of it this way, the science-users build the base of the creation (specifically the Lor and the Novas), and Hyness’s clan imbues them with the “incredible power,” in other words, magic. That would explain how the
        Lor can traverse space and time and how the Novas can grant wishes. The clan most likely also made the Star Rods and the FoD, which have more to do with magic than science. Now, moving on to the Master Crown. It is theorized that it has something
        to do with Dark Matter, right? Given that the clan were worshippers of a matter most dark, it could be possible that they made the crown using Dark Matter. That would explain why Void Termina, the final boss of Star Allies and the reincarnation
        of the implied ancestor of Dark Matter, uses a replica of it in his boss fight. Speaking of Void Termina, his normal self, simply known as Void, is reportedly spoken about in several books that were written by the ancients after witnessing his
        starlike radiance. One of these books is likely the book of legend, which basically called Void a god. This book is presumed to be written by Hyness’s clan, due to him saying that everyone else thought it was a fairytale. And so, that is all the
        information surrounding the ancients so far. This is...really long. Anyway, next time, we’ll be talking about our favorite one-eyed family that corrupts planets, as well as their baby-faced presumed ancestor. See you around!

    <h2 id="title2">All of Kirby Lore in one post</h2>
    <h6 class="name">By: SockBiscit - 02/04/2020</h6>
    <p>Thousands, maybe millions of years before the Kirby games, there were the Ancients. They were scientists, architects. Driven by fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of death. They discovered a matter most dark, and would do anything to conceal it. They
        built weapons with hopes that a hero would arise and fell the beast. They made seals. Sealing away all that they feared, knowing something else would deal with it. They left their seals on a quaint, underpopulated planet, assuming they would be
        safe. They built the clockwork stars, Planet sized satellites with the power to grant wishes. Dream fountains were scattered across the universe, and only when given enough dream power would the clockwork stars activate. But this backfired. Beings
        evil of heart used them to destroy, hurt and control. Nothing the Ancients did stopped them. An Ancient calling himself Hyness arrived with three mages. They, with their unscientific powers, destroyed the clockwork stars. All, but one. The ancients
        had fear that history would repeat itself, and these ungodly wizards would destroy them, once and for all. So, like all threats before them, Hyness and the three Mage-Sisters, were sealed, and banished to the far reaches of the universe. Needing
        a protector, the ancients made a Knight. The ultimate warrior. The ultimate LIFE, Designed to follow all commands. But evil gripped the warrior's soul. It shed It's form, and raw power emerged. It destroyed planets with a beat of it's wings, Ripped
        reality with a slice of it's sword. Nothing could stop it. The ancients prayed to their god, needing help. Their fear led hem to hide, not interfering in the slightest. The galactic knight ripped the species to shreds. With the last of their power,
        the ancients did all they knew. They sealed the knight. And with that, the ancients were gone. Except, one descendant. Magolor, named after the ancientspeak word for paradise. At some point, Ice Dragons seemingly go extinct. Millions of years
        later, Max Haltmann discovers presence of intense power. He builds it a robot body, and it reveals itself to be Star Dream. No longer linked to it's ancient programming, It now has free will. That free will gives it a will to destroy. Star Dream
        helps Haltmann in his studies, secretly using the man to achieve it's full power. Inter dimensional gates are discovered, and with his knowledge, Haltmann builds a company, wanting the best for his daughter, Susanne. One day, a particularly large
        rip is opened, and Susanne is pulled inside. Driven mad by the loss of his daughter, Haltmann lives through the day by thinking about using Star Dream to bring her back. Star Dream has no intent of doing this however, as It slowly corrupts Haltmann's
        mind. Susanne has landed in Another Dimension. Hopping between dimensions and worlds, she obtains data on multiple species and planets, including Popstar. Around the same time, Magolor, a space traveler, draws near the milky way, and as he gets
        closer to Popstar, he gets closer to the Master Crown, and his mind is slowly drawn in. Into the Void. Later, on Popstar, near the beginning of Spring, Kirby is born. Later, nearing Popstar, Magolor meets a seemingly kind person named Marx. Marx
        asks of the whereabouts of the last remaining clockwork star, Galactic Nova. Magolor informs him that a strong being must activate the dream fountains, and that one already has been activated. Marx heads back to Popstar, knowing what to do. Some
        time later, Meta Knight discovers a dangerous mirror, one of many ancient seals, and in an attempt to destroy it, he awakens Dark Mind, and creates an alternate world. After Kirby defeats Dark Mind, a being of the sky named Taranza steals the
        mirror from it's hiding place in the clouds. Hoping to give it to his girlfriend and queen, Sectonia, he returns to Floralia. She accepts the gift, but Dark Meta Knight, the last link to Dark Mind, begins the corruption of the Queen's mind, twisting
        and turning her view of the world. Later, Susanne finds her father's company, currently in the process of mechanizing countless planets. Susanne applies for secretary under the name Susie, with the intent of taking control of Star Dream, and taking
        her revenge. Magolor arrives on Popstar and tries to steal the Master Crown from it's guardian, Landia, the four headed dragon. With help from Kirby and Friends, who were tricked into it, Magolor forms the ultimate bond with Void Termina, as his
        Soul is ripped from his body. After defeating Magolor's lifeless body, Kirby and friends escape from Another Dimension as it falls apart. Little did they know, the disturbances of reality allowed Hyness and the mages to break their own seal. Uniting
        other followers of their religion, they search for shards of power to unite the dark heart and revive the god, Void Termina. After the defeat of Sectonia and Star Dream, The Jambastion Mages have assembled the dark heart, and they intend to revive
        Void Termina and destroy the world that wronged them so much.
